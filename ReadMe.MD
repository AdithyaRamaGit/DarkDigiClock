# ðŸ•’ Digital Clock

This project is a simple digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds along with AM/PM notation. The clock updates every second using `setInterval` for real-time accuracy.

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-time updates (HH:MM:SS)
- AM/PM format conversion
- Leading zero padding for single-digit values
- Easy DOM manipulation
- Minimal and clean UI

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling (optional enhancement)
- **JavaScript** for logic and interactivity

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your local project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Watch the time tick awayâ€”accurately and elegantly!

## ðŸ§  Learnings
This project reinforces:
- DOM manipulation with `getElementById`
- Time handling using the `Date` object
- Efficient use of `setInterval` for live updates
- Basic conditional logic for AM/PM formatting
